# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Codemod.com team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

- For **non-critical security bugs**, please use the [issues page](https://github.com/codemod-com/codemod/issues) or the [Slack channel](https://codemod.com/community).
- For **critical security vulnerabilities** (those that could result in data loss, remote code execution, or compromise of user accounts), **please report them privately**:
  - Email: [security@codemod.com](mailto:security@codemod.com)
  - Slack: DM us in our [community Slack](https://codemod.com/community)

**Do not disclose critical vulnerabilities publicly until we have confirmed and patched the issue.**

The Codemod.com team may send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the team may keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
