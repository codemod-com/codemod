Codemod Studio is an AI workbench for creating codemods. Codemods are powerful code automation bots that can automate many crucial yet tedious coding tasks, such as migrations, upgrades, large-scale changes, enforcing best practices, and bringing conformity to a codebase. However, building codemods manually is a time-consuming process.

Codemod Studio allows you to “instantly” create code automation bots with the help of AI, specialized helpers, and debuggers, as well as a vibrant community of “codemod champions.”

## Features

### 1. Build

With the help of fine-tuned LLMs under-the-hood and codemod creation features such as expert-curated prompts, and smart highlighting, Codemod Studio can help you build codemods in a few minutes.

### 2. Test

Codemod Studio allows you to iteratively test, debug, and improve your codemods as you build them.

### 3. Run

With close integration with Codemod platform, Codemod Studio allows you to easily run your codemods over your projects using Codemod CLI, VS Code Extension, or on your GitHub repositories right from the studio.
