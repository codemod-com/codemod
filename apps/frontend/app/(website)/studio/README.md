Codemod Studio is an AI workbench for creating codemods. Codemods are powerful code automation bots that can automate many crucial yet tedious coding tasks, such as migrations, upgrades, large-scale changes, enforcing best practices, and bringing conformity to a codebase. However, building codemods manually is a time-consuming process.

Codemod Studio allows you to “instantly” create code automation bots with the help of AI, specialized helpers, and debuggers, as well as a vibrant community of “codemod champions.”

## Features

With the help of fine-tuned LLMs under-the-hood and codemod creation features such as expert-curated prompts, smart highlighting & GUI codemod builder, Codemod Studio can help you build codemods in a few minutes.

### 2. Test

Codemod Studio allows you to iteratively test, debug, and improve your codemods as you build them.

### 3. Run

With close integration with Codemod platform, Codemod Studio allows you to easily run your codemods over your projects using Codemod CLI or VS Code Extension.
