[Codemod Studio](https://codemod.studio/) is an AI workbench for creating codemods. Codemods are powerful code automation bots that can automate many crucial yet tedious coding tasks, such as migrations, upgrades, large-scale changes, enforcing best practices, and bringing conformity to a codebase. However, building them has been very hard and time-consuming. Until now.

Codemod Studio allows you to "instantly" create code automation bots with the help of AI, specialized helpers, and debuggers, as well as a vibrant community of "codemod champions."
