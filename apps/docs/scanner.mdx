The Migration Analyzer provides valuable unique insights into migration opportunities, such as dependency upgrades, security improvements, internationalization, and more.

The Migration Analyzer scans your repositories to provide industry benchmarks, counts files using specific dependencies, and highlights vulnerabilities in both direct and transitive dependencies, empowering you to identify high-impact opportunities with confidence.

## Key Features

- **Later Versions Adoption (LVA)**: A metric that helps you compare your project with those who are using the same or more modern version of a given package. This is a proxy of how far you are behind others when it comes to each dependency.
- **Usage Insights**: Find out how many files import a specific package, helping you estimate the effort required for migration. Our Rust-powered ast-grep codemods provide insights you won't get from other tools. This gives you a sense of the required effort and number of files to change.
- **Security Impact**: Highlight migrations that address different categories of vulnerabilities, enhancing your project's security and compliance posture.
- **Direct vs. Indirect Dependencies**: Identify whether dependencies are direct or indirect. For indirect dependencies, see how many steps they are from your main project. The analyzer flags indirect dependencies used directly in your codeâ€”a practice best avoided.
- **Monorepo Support**: Trace dependencies back to their specific packages within a monorepo, giving you clearer insight into your project's structure.
- **Current vs. Suggested Versions**: See how many versions behind your dependencies are and get recommendations for updates.
