Codemod platform allows you to build a wide variety of codemods and easily distribute them to different parts of the platform, such as the [Codemod Registry](/codemod-registry/), [CLI](/deploying-codemods/cli), and [VS Code extension](/deploying-codemods/vsce). This allows them to be discovered, shared, and used by the community.

To do so, codemods must follow the [required codemod package structure](/codemod-registry/publishing-codemods#required-codemod-package-structure).

There are two ways of scaffolding a new codemod package that follow the required package structure:

## Option 1: Initialize using CLI

You can quickly create a codemod package using the Codemod CLI and start developing with supported codemod engines such as: `ast-grep`, `filemod`, `jscodeshift`, `ts-morph`, or `piranha`.

To do so, run the following command:

```bash
codemod init
```

<Tip>
To easily scaffold the codemod package, Codemod CLI prompt you to answer a few questions about your codemod. You can use the `-y` flag to skip the questions and use the default values.
</Tip>

## Option 2: Use Codemod Studio

[Codemod Studio](/building-codemods/codemod-studio) allows you to easily create codemods with the power of AI. All codemods built and/or exported by Codemod Studio will automatically conform to the package structure required by Codemod platform.
