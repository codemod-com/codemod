Codemod platform allows users to build codemods of various complexity and make them all available in a single place.
To execute this idea properly, we must introduce a solid structure for compatible codemod packages and a way to share them with the community.

First, one must understand [the structure of a codemod package](/building-codemods/configuration) and how to build one.
To make this process easier, we provide two easy ways of scaffolding a new codemod package and start developing right away.

### 1. Initialize using CLI

You can quickly create a codemod package using the Codemod CLI and start developing with tools already known by the community.

To do so, run the following command:

```bash
codemod init
```

You'll be prompted to answer a few questions about your codemod package, and the CLI will scaffold the project for you.

<Tip>
You can use the `-y` flag to skip the questions and use the default values.
</Tip>

### 2. Use Codemod Studio

[Codemod Studio](/building-codemods/codemod-studio) is a web-based tool that allows you to create a new codemod package with the power of AI.
You can describe your before and after code examples, and Codemod Studio will generate the codemod for you.

You can then download the codemod package using `Export locally` button and start developing right away.

<Tip>
If you're using Codemod Visual Studio Code extension, you can import the studio-generated codemod package directly into your workspace.
