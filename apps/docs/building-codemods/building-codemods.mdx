title: "Building Your First Codemod"
---

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build, publish, and run your first codemod. During this process you will learn different concepts such as:

- [Building codemod packages with Codemod Studio](#building-codemods-with-codemod-studio)
- [Configuring codemod packages using `.codemodrc.json`](#configuring-codemod-packages)
- [Publishing codemods to Codemod Registry](#publishing-the-codemod-package)
- [Running codemods using Codemod CLI](#running-codemods)

To keep this tutorial practical, you will learn these concepts by creating a codemod that addresses string refs deprecation in React 19. However, these concepts will apply to many codemods you will build for various use cases moving forward.

## Building codemods with Codemod Studio

To get started, we will head to [Codemod Studio](https://codemod.com/studio). Codemod Studio uses tuned Codemod AI to build codemods using before/after code examples. You can learn more about Codemod Studio [here](/codemod-studio).

To start building the codemod:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Add before/after code examples">
        We will use the [before/after code examples in the React 19 migration guide](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide#removed-string-refs).

        In this case, the following transformation should happen:

        ```jsx Before
        <div ref='refName' />;
        ```

        Should be transformed into:

        ```jsx After
        <div ref={(ref) => (this.refs.refName = ref)} />;
        ```

        We will add these before/after code examples to the before and after code panes in Codemod Studio:

        <video
        autoPlay
        loop
        className="w-full aspect-video"
        src="/images/guides/building-codemods/add-before-after.mp4"
        ></video>

        <Tip>
            You can add multiple before/after code snippets to cover edge cases. Please refer to [Codemod Studio's tips and best practices](/codemod-studio#tips-and-tricks-for-writing-better-tests-and-codemods) while adding more test cases.
        </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Optional: Use natural language descriptions">
        To improve codemod generation accuracy, you can provide more context about the transformation to Codemod AI by adding [natural language descriptions](/codemod-studio#natural-language-descriptions-in-examples).

        <video
        autoPlay
        loop
        className="w-full aspect-video"
        src="/images/guides/building-codemods/nld.mp4"
        ></video>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Build codemod with AI">
        By clicking "Autogenerate with Codemod AI" Codemod Studio will begin building your codemod.

        <video
        autoPlay
        loop
        className="w-full aspect-video"
        src="/images/guides/building-codemods/generating-codemod.mp4"
        ></video>

    </Step>
    <Step title="Test codemod (and iterate)">
        After the codemod is generated, it will automatically be pasted into the codemod editor on the right side. The `Output` panel will show the result of running the codemod over the `Before` snippet in real time.

        This allows you to compare the actual output of the codemod to the `After` snippet. If Codemod Studio detects discrepancies between the `Output` and `After` snippet, the code example will be highlighted in red.

        Fixing various issues:

        <AccordionGroup>
            <Accordion title="Codemod execution error" icon="alien-8bit">
                If a codemod execution error occurs, you can troubleshoot the codemod by inspecting the execution steps in the `Debug`.

                <video
                autoPlay
                loop
                className="w-full aspect-video"
                src="/images/guides/building-codemods/debug.mp4"
                ></video>

                You can then ask Codemod AI to iterate and fix the codemod using the LLM chatbot.
            </Accordion>

            <Accordion title="Inaccurate codemod output" icon="circle-xmark">
                If the codemod output is incorrect, you can:
                - ask Codemod AI to fix the inaccuracies using the LLM chatbot (or generating again)
                - provide more context to Codemod AI using natural language descriptions (refer to step 2)
            </Accordion>
        </AccordionGroup>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Exporting codemod">
        Once your codemod is working correctly, you can:
        - export the codemod package locally
        - publish it to your private registry

        In this tutorial, we will export the codemod package locally as we will be publishing to the public Codemod Registry in the next steps.

        To export the codemod package, you can click **Download and run locally**.

    </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring codemod packages

Now that we have a local codemod package, we can configure the `.codemodrc.json` file. Doing so helps Codemod platform understand more information about your codemod package to allow for a better publishing and running experience to your codemod.

To configure the `.codemodrc.json` file, you can:

1. Open `.codemodrc.json` using your preferred editor.
2. Customize configuration fields.

    By default, the file will look something similar to this:

    ```json .codemodrc.json
    {
        "$schema": "https://codemod-utils.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/configuration_schema.json",
        "name": "react-19-callback-ref-replace",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "engine": "jscodeshift",
        "private": false,
        "arguments": [],
        "meta": {}
    }
    ```

    In this example, we will:
    1. adjust the previous auto-generated `name` value
    2. populate the `meta` and `applicability` fields.
    
    This will allow our codemod to integrate better with Codemod Registry's search and filtering so that users can find this codemod easily.

    ```json .codemodrc.json
    {
        "$schema": "https://codemod-utils.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/configuration_schema.json",
        "name": "react/19/replace-string-ref",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "engine": "jscodeshift",
        "private": false,
        "arguments": [],
        "meta": {
            "git": "https://github.com/codemod-com/codemod/tree/main/packages/codemods/react/19/replace-string-ref",
            "tags": ["react", "migration"]
        },
        "applicability": {
            "from": [["react", "<=", "18"]]
        }
    }
    ```

    <Tip>
        You can find a list of all supported `.codemodrc.json` fields [here](/building-codemods/package-requirements#codemodrc-json-reference).
    </Tip>

## Publishing the codemod package

Now that our codemod package is ready, we can publish it to Codemod Registry. To do so, you can:

1. navigate to the root directory of the codemod package
2. logging in with `codemod login`
3. running `codemod publish`

<Tip>
    To learn more about publishing codemods, refer to [this guide](/sharing/publishing-codemods).
</Tip>

Now, your codemod will be available for anyone to discover and run from Codemod Registry.

<Info>
    You can find the published codemod built in this example [here](https://go.codemod.com/react-replace-string-ref).
</Info>

## Running codemods

Finally, we can run the published codemod using [Codemod CLI](/deploying-codemods/cli). To do so, you can:

1. Navigate to your target project

2. Run the codemod:

```bash
codemod [codemod-name]
```

In this example, we can run the codemod using:

```bash
codemod react/19/replace-string-ref
```

<Warning>By default, running the codemod will attempt to apply the transformation on all target files in the current directory. Make sure to run the codemod in the correct project directory.</Warning>
