Codemod Studio allows you to "instantly" create code automation bots with the help of AI, specialized helpers, and debuggers, as well as a vibrant community of "codemod champions."

## Building codemods with Codemod Studio

<Steps>

<Step title="Add before/after snippets">
  The user-defined code snippets in the before/after panels are used by the AI helper to generate a codemod based on the changes in code between both snippets.

  To start building codemods, you can:
  1. insert the original code into the 'Before' panel, then insert how the code should look like after transformation into the 'After' panel
  2. or you can use the [`codemod learn`](/deploying-codemods/cli#generate-codemod-from-file-diff) command straight from your IDE/CLI to automatically populate the before/after snippets. // TODO: update link when cli doc is updated
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use AI helper">
  The assistant section provides support and guidance throughout the codemod creation and execution process. It leverages AI to help users generate codemod scripts, troubleshoot issues, and refine their code transformations.

  To use the AI helper, make sure that the before/after panels are correctly populated, then use the available [actions](#actions) or [prompt builders](#prompt-builders) to iteratively build your codemod.

  <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion
      title="Actions"
    >
      The actions area includes tools and options to create and fix codemods. These actions operate independently from the prompt.

      1. **Building a codemod:** you can use the `Build a codemod to transform before to after` action to automatically build a codemod using the default prompt.
      2. **Fixing codemod errors:** if the generated codemod has an error, you can use the `Fix codemod error` action to automatically try fixing the caught error.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion
      title="Prompt builders"
    >
      The prompt builders assist users in crafting precise and effective prompts for generating codemods.
      
      These builders provide aliases and templates to streamline the prompt creation process, making it easier for users to specify their desired code transformations accurately.
    </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Codemod editor">
  The codemod editor allows you to review and edit the generated codemod. This makes it easy to tweak your codemod without having to leave your studio environment.
</Step>

<Step title="Output panel">
  The output panel dynamically reflects how the codemod affects the `Before` snippet in real-time.
  
  This immediate feedback loop helps you quickly identify and correct any issues in your codemod without having to export and run it over your local project.
</Step>

<Step title="AST viewer">
  The AST viewer enables you to see a detailed view of the before and after snippets' Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
  
  This feature is especially useful for experienced codemod builders who want to edit/build codemods manually.

  <Note>
    The AST viewer is made for more advanced codemod developers. If you intend to build codemods using the AI helper only, you can skip using this feature.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Debugger">
  The debugger displays the events that occur any caught errors when running the codemod. This allows you to easily trace and debug your codemod if it doesn't work as expected.

  <Tip>
    You can use `console.log` in the codemod editor to print out any output in the debugger.
  </Tip>
</Step>

</Steps>

## Sharing codemods

After building a codemod, you can click 'Share' to get a shareable public link to your codemod. This allows you to easily share and test your codemods with friends, team members, and the community.

## Running codemods

To run the codemod over your local project, you can:
1. click "Run locally via CLI" to export and download the codemod package
2. [run the codemod using Codemod CLI](/deploying-codemods/cli#running-codemods). // TODO: update this link when the running codemods section in cli doc is updated
