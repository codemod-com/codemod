title: Package requirements
---

A codemod package is compatible with Codemod platform when it:

1. uses a supported codemod engine

2. has a valid `.codemodrc.json` configuration file in its root directory

3. has a valid codemod package structure.

The `.codemodrc.json` configuration file allows Codemod platform to better understand information about your codemod, as well as bring an [enhanced running experience](/platform/run#benefits-and-features).

The structure of the codemod package can vary based on the codemod engine used. This document explains the requirements for a valid codemod package for each of the supported codemod engines.

## Supported codemod engines

Codemod platform currently supports the following codemod engines: [`ast-grep`](https://github.com/ast-grep/ast-grep), [`jscodeshift`](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift), [`ts-morph`](https://github.com/dsherret/ts-morph), [`Workflow Engine`](/deploying-codemods/workflow-engine), and [`piranha`](https://github.com/uber/piranha).

## `.codemodrc.json` reference

The `.codemodrc.json` configuration file includes several metafields that can be used to help Codemod platform understand more information about your codemod package.

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  Specifies the slugified name of the codemod published to the codemod registry.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="version" type="string" required>
  Specifies the current codemod version. Should follow the [SemVer scheme](https://semver.org/).
  <Warning>The version field must be bumped every time the codemod is published.</Warning>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="private" type="boolean" default="false">
  Can be used to set the codemod visibility to `private`.

  By default, when a codemod is published without a namespace, visibility will be set as `public`.
  If a codemod is published under a namespace, such as `@codemod/my-codemod`, visibility will be set as `private`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="engine" type="string" required>
  Specifies the engine used to run the codemod.
  Can be any of:

  * `ast-grep`

  * `jscodeshift`

  * `ts-morph`

  * `workflow`

  * `recipe` (requires additional `names` field, which is an ordered array of codemod names that will be executed)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="include" type="glob pattern array">
  Can be used to override the default glob pattern for files that will be processed by the codemod.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="applicability" type="object">
  The applicability field is an object with `from` and `to` keys that are both arrays of tuples.
  This field can be used to specify the dependencies and versions this codemod is made for.

  Specifying the applicability criteria of your codemod helps:

  1. Reduce false positives

  2. Proactively recommend the codemod to users who might need it

  3. Improve codemod performance, as it will only process projects that make sense

  4. Allow daisy-chaining codemods (e.g., migrating from v1 to v3 by combining v1-to-v2 and v2-to-v3 codemods)

  Each tuple consists of three elements:

  1. a library name

  2. a comparison operator (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `=`)

  3. a version number ([SemVer](https://semver.org/) compatible)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="deps" type="array of strings">
  Can be used to specify dependencies to be installed after successful a codemod run.
  You can also specify a package to be removed by prepending it with a `-` sign.
  Each dependency should be a string in one of the following formats:

  * `package-name@version`

  * `-package-name`

  * `package-name`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="arguments" type="array of objects">
  If your codemod requires arguments, you can specify them in this field.

  <Expandable title="Argument fields">
    <ResponseField name="name" type="string">
      Specifies the argument name.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="description" type="string">
      Specifies the argument description.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="kind" type="string">
      Specifies the argument argument type. Can be any of: `string`, `number`, or `boolean`.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="required" type="boolean">
      Specifies if the argument is required.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="meta" type="object">
  Specifies additional information about your codemod for discoverability purposes.

  <Expandable title="Meta child fields">
    <ResponseField name="tags" type="array of strings">
      Specifies tags for your codemods (ex: next.js, react).
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="git" type="string">
      Specifies the url to the codemod's repository.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="entry" type="string">
  Can be used to specify custom entrypoint path of the codemod.

  <Note>By default, the entrypoint path is determined by the engine. JavaScript engines use `src/index.{js,ts}` path and ast-grep uses `**/rule.yaml` patterns.</Note>
</ResponseField>

    ```

    Codemod recipes are a collection of codemods that are run in consecutive order. Codemod recipes allow you to daisy-chain a set of codemods that help with a large-scope migration.

    Unlike JavaScript and ast-grep codemods, recipes do not inlcude input files in `.codemodrc.json`. To specify codemods that should be run by the recipe, simply add the codemod names under the `names` field.
