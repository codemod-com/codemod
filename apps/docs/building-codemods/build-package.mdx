title: Building a codemod package
---

You can build a codemod package using three different ways:
- Build with Codemod Studio
- Build with `codemod learn`
- Scaffold a codemod package

By building a codemod with Codemod Studio or with `codemod learn`, your codemod package will automatically have the recommended [package structure](/building-codemods/package-requirements).

If you build a codemod from scratch or a previously built codemod, you will have to scaffold a valid codemod package using Codemod CLI.

## Building with Codemod Studio

To learn how to build codemods with Codemod Studio, please refer to the [detailed Codemod Studio usage guide](/codemod-studio#building-codemods-with-codemod-studio).

## Building with `codemod learn`

You can use `codemod learn` to build a codemod from the latest diff made in your current project. This allows you to seamlessly build codemods right from your IDE.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Make a change">
        Start by manually making change in a file that you would like to see repeated over many files in your project.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run `codemod learn`">
        Open a terminal in your current project and run `codemod learn`. Codemod AI will use the diff of the latest edited file to automatically generate a codemod.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Building the codemod">
        Codemod Studio will automatically open, with pre-populated data, and begin building your codemod. Allow Codemod Studio to finish generating your codemod.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Export/publish the generated codemod">
        After Codemod Studio builds your codemod, you can easily [export and run your codemod](/codemod-studio#running-codemods) over your local project.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Scaffolding a codemod package

Scaffolding a codemod package allows you to either:
1. manually write your own codemod
2. turn an existing codemod into a Codemod-compatible package.

To scaffold a new codemod package, you should:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Verify codemod engine compatibility">
        Verify that the existing codemod is built by one of the [supported codemod engines](/building-codemods/package-requirements#supported-codemod-engines).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Initialize codemod package">
        Initialize a Codemod-compatible package by running:
        ```bash
        codemod init
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Update transform file content">
        <Card title="For jscodeshift/ts-morph/filemod codemods:">
        Update the content inside the `src/index.ts` file with the content of your codemod's transform file.
        </Card>
        <Card title="For ast-grep codemods:">
        Update the content inside the `src/rule.yaml` file with the content of your ast-grep rule.
        </Card>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Update package configuration file">
        Add information about your codemod to the `.codemodrc.json` configuration file. Refer to [`.codemodrc.json` reference here](/building-codemods/package-requirements#codemodrc-json-reference).
    </Step>
</Steps>
