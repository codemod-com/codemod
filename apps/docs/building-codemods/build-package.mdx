title: Building a codemod package
---

You can build a codemod package using three different ways:
- Build with Codemod Studio
- Scaffold a package with Codemod CLI

By building a codemod with Codemod Studio, your codemod package will automatically have the required [package structure](/building-codemods/package-requirements).

If you build a codemod from scratch or a previously built codemod, you will have to scaffold a valid codemod package using Codemod CLI.

## Building with Codemod Studio

To learn how to build codemods with Codemod Studio, please refer to the [detailed Codemod Studio usage guide](/codemod-studio).

## Scaffolding a codemod package

Scaffolding a codemod package allows you to either:
1. manually write your own codemod
2. turn an existing codemod into a Codemod-compatible package.

To scaffold a new codemod package, you should:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Verify codemod engine compatibility">
        Verify that the existing codemod is built by one of the [supported codemod engines](/building-codemods/package-requirements#supported-codemod-engines).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Initialize codemod package">
        Initialize a Codemod-compatible package by running:
        ```bash
        codemod init
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Update transform file content">
        <Card title="For jscodeshift/ts-morph/workflow codemods:">
        Update the content inside the `src/index.ts` file with the content of your codemod's transform file.
        </Card>
        <Card title="For ast-grep codemods:">
        Update the content inside the `src/rule.yaml` file with the content of your ast-grep rule.
        </Card>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Update package configuration file">
        Add information about your codemod to the `.codemodrc.json` configuration file. Refer to [`.codemodrc.json` reference here](/building-codemods/package-requirements#codemodrc-json-reference).
    </Step>
</Steps>
