Codemods allow you to land large-scale changes over your codebase that help with repetitive refactors, code migrations, and dependency upgrades.

The Codemod platform allows you to run and orchestrate codemods during codebase migrations.

Both, the Codemod [CLI](/deploying-codemods/cli) and [VS Code extension](/deploying-codemods/vsce) allow you to explore and run any codemod available in the Codemod Registry.
