The Codemod command-line interface (CLI) allows you to interact with Codemod platform using a terminal or through an automated system.

The Codemod CLI accepts a variety of subcommands and options to explore, publish, and run codemods.

<Note>The Codemod CLI requires Node.js v16+.</Note>

## Installation

```bash
npm i -g codemod
```

## Build

### `codemod learn`

The `learn` command uses the diff of the latest edited file to automatically build a codemod using [Codemod Studio](/building-codemods/codemod-studio/).

After running this command, if any git diff exists, the Codemod Engine will use the diff as before/after snippets in Codemod Studio.

```bash
codemod learn
```

### `codemod build`

Can be used to build a JavaScript codemod package. If you are using any of the [supported JavaScript codemod engines](/guides/building-codemods/package-requirements#supported-codemod-engines), you can use the CLI to build the main executable file.

```bash
codemod build
```

## Share/discover

### `codemod search`

Can be used to list the codemods available in Codemod Registry and optionally search for a specific codemod using its name or tags.

Aliases: `list` and `ls`

```bash
codemod search [optional-search-query]
```

This command has special flags available to it that can be combined together to perform more advanced searches.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Your codemods">
    ```bash
    codemod search [optional-search-query] --mine
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="All the codemods (including hidden)">
    ```bash
    codemod search [optional-search-query] --all
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Your codemods (including hidden)">
    ```bash
    codemod search [optional-search-query] --mine --all
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### `codemod init`

Can be used to scaffold a new codemod package.

```bash
codemod init
```

### `codemod publish`

Can be used to publish a codemod to Codemod Registry.

Publishing codemods requires [logging in](#other-commands) to Codemod platform and having a codemod that is [compatible with Codemod Registry](/guides/building-codemods/package-requirements).

To do so, use the `publish` command inside the codemod package directory:

```bash
codemod publish
```

Alternatively, you can publish a codemod at <Tooltip tip="This path can point to a simple transform file or a Codemod-compatible package.">the target path</Tooltip>:

```bash
codemod publish [path] --target
```

### `codemod unpublish`

Can be used to unpublish a codemod you own from Codemod Registry.

You can publish a specific version of your codemods using:

```bash
codemod unpublish [codemod-name]@[version]
```

Or you can completely unpublish your codemod, including all versions, from the registry:

```bash
codemod unpublish [codemod-name] -f
```

## Run

### `codemod run`

You can use the `codemod` command to run codemods.

Codemod CLI allows you to run codemods:
1. from [Codemod Registry](/codemod-registry)
2. from source
    - using a <Tooltip tip="A codemod package is a codemod with a valid `.codemodrc.json` configuration file.">codemod package</Tooltip>
    - using a <Tooltip tip="This file can be a simple transfofrm file using any of the supported codemod engines.">transform file</Tooltip>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Run from Codemod Registry">
    ```bash
    codemod [codemod-name]
    ```

    <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Example">
      <Steps>
      <Step title="Go to project directory">
        Make sure you are in the project directory to avoid running the codemod over the wrong directory on your machine.
      </Step>
      <Step title="List available codemods">
        Run `codemod list` to see all available codemods in Codemod Registry. Alternatively, you can search for codemods of a specific framework like `codemod search next.js`.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Run codemod">
        In this example, we will run the `next/13/app-router-recipe` codemod.

        To do so, we will run:

        ```bash
        codemod next/13/app-router-recipe
        ```

      </Step>
    </Steps>
    </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Run from source">
    To run a local codemod package, you can:
    ```bash
    codemod -s [path]
    ```

    or you can run a transform file ([using a supported codemod engine](/guides/building-codemods/package-requirements#supported-codemod-engines)) by using:
    ```bash
    codemod -s [path] --engine [codemod-engine]
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
When using the `codemod` command, Codemod CLI will attempt to run a codemod as long as it is not followed by a reserved command name.
</Note>

### Options

The following options can be used to change the default behavior of Codemod CLI.

<ResponseField name="--include (-i)" type="glob pattern" default="Defined by the codemod engine">
  Can be used to specify the files to be targeted by the codemod.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Including files">
    ```bash
    codemod [codemod-name] -i "example_file"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Including folders">
    ```bash
    codemod [codemod-name] -i "example_folder/"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Including specific file extensions">
    ```bash
    codemod [codemod-name] -i "*.js"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>Due to performance reasons, Codemod CLI does not check if the path in the defined pattern is a file or directory. Folders should be defined with a trailing slash. Every other entry will be treated as a file.</Warning>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--exclude (-e)" type="glob pattern" default="node_modules/, dist/, build/, .next/, .git/">
  While running a codemod, you may want to prevent changes from occurring to specific parts of your project. The `--exclude` option can be used to specify a glob pattern of the files to be ignored by the codemod.

  By default, Codemod CLI excludes the patterns defined in the `.gitignore` found in the project's root directory.
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Excluding files">
    ```bash
    codemod [codemod-name] -e "example_file"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Excluding folders">
    ```bash
    codemod [codemod-name] -e "example_folder/"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Excluding specific file extensions">
    ```bash
    codemod [codemod-name] -e "*.js"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>Due to performance reasons, Codemod CLI does not check if the path in the defined pattern is a file or directory. Folders should be defined with a trailing slash. Every other entry will be treated as a file.</Warning>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--target (-t)" type="string">
  Can be used to specify the directory of your project that the CLI should target while running codemods. This option is set as the current directory by default.

```bash
codemod [codemod-name] -t [path]
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--dry (-d)" type="boolean">
  Can be used to switch to dry run mode. Dry running codemods helps you see the changes the codemod will make without affecting the project files.

```bash
codemod [codemod-name] --dry
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--readme" type="string">
  Prints the readme (description) of the codemod.

```bash
codemod [codemod-name] --readme
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--config" type="string">
  Prints the configuration of the codemod.

```bash
codemod [codemod-name] --config
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--format" type="boolean">
  Can be used to enable prettier formatting to the files affected by the codemod.

```bash
codemod [codemod-name] --format
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--no-cache" type="boolean">
  Can be used to disable caching downloaded codemod files.

```bash
codemod [codemod-name] --no-cache
```

  <Tip>Disabling cache can ensure you are getting the freshest results. While keeping the cache enabled can help you save bandwidth and time for repetitive use of the same codemods.</Tip>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--no-install" type="boolean">
  Can be used to disable dependencies installation after codemod run.

```bash
codemod [codemod-name] --no-install
```

  <Warning>Some codemods may install or remove dependencies after running.
  This option allows you to disable that behavior and handle dependency upgrades manually.</Warning>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--no-telemetry" type="boolean">
  Can be used to disable CLI telemetry data collection.

```bash
codemod [codemod-name] --no-telemetry
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--json (-j)" type="boolean">
  Can be used to switch the CLI responses to JSON format.

```bash
codemod [codemod-name] --json
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--threads (-n)" type="number" default="4">
  Can be used to specify the number of worker threads the CLI uses while running codemods.

```bash
codemod [codemod-name] -n [number-of-threads]
```
</ResponseField>

## Other commands

<ResponseField name="codemod login">
Can be used to login to Codemod platform.

```bash
codemod login
