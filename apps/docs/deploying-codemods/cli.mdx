The Codemod command-line interface (CLI) allows you to interact with Codemod platform using a terminal or through an automated system.

The Codemod CLI accepts a variety of subcommands and options to explore, publish, and run codemods.

<Note>The Codemod CLI requires Node.js v16+.</Note>

## Installation

```bash
npm i -g codemod
```

## List available codemods

The <Tooltip tip='Available aliases: `ls` and `search`'>`list`</Tooltip> command can be used to list the codemods available in the Codemod Registry and optionally search for a specific codemod using its name or tags.

```bash
codemod list [optional search query]
```

## Running codemods

You can use the `codemod` command to run codemods.

This command uses the following format:

```bash
codemod [codemod name]
```

<Note>
When using the `codemod` command, Codemod CLI will attempt to run a codemod as long as it is not followed by a reserved command name.

<Accordion title="Example">
  <Steps>
  <Step title="Go to project directory">
    Make sure you are in the project directory to avoid running the codemod over the wrong directory on your machine.
  </Step>
  <Step title="List available codemods">
    Run `codemod list` to see all available codemods in the Codemod Registry.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run codemod">
    In this example, we will run the `next/13/app-router-recipe` codemod.

    To do so, we will run:

    ```bash
    codemod next/13/app-router-recipe
    ```

  </Step>

### Available options

The following options can be used to change the default behavior of the Codemod CLI.

<ResponseField name="--include (-i)" type="glob pattern" default="Defined by the codemod engine">
  Can be used to specify the files to be targeted by the codemod.

```bash
codemod [codemod name] -i "certain_file" -i "entire_folder/" -i "*.js"
```

<Warning>Folders should be defined with a trailing slash, for example `node_modules/`. Every other entry will be treated as a file. We don't check whether the paths under a certain glob pattern are directories or not for performance reasons.</Warning>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--exclude (-e)" type="glob pattern" default="'node_modules/', 'dist/', 'build/', '.next/'">
  While running a codemod, you may want to prevent changes from occurring to specific parts of your project. The `--exclude` option can be used to specify a glob pattern of the files to be ignored by the codemod.

```bash
codemod [codemod name] -e "certain_file" -e "entire_folder/" -e "*.py"
```
  
<Note>By default, Codemod CLI would also look for your project's root `.gitignore` file and exclude the patterns defined in it. The trailing slash rule mentioned in `--include` command description also applies to the `--exclude` option.</Note>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--target (-t)" type="string">
  Can be used to specify the directory of your project that the CLI should target while running codemods. This option is set as the current directory by default.

```bash
codemod [codemod name] -t [path]
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--source (-s)" type="string">
  Can be used to specify the path to the codemod package folder stored locally that you want to run using the Codemod CLI.

  If your local codemod follows the recommended [codemod package structure](/codemod-registry/publishing-codemods#required-codemod-package-structure), it will include a `.codemodrc.json` file. By default, Codemod CLI will attempt using the engine specified in `.codemodrc.json`. Otherwise, you will need to specify the codemod engine manually.

  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Codemods with `.codemodrc.json`">
      ```bash
      codemod -s [path]
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Codemods without `.codemodrc.json`">
      ```bash
      codemod -s [path] --engine jscodeshift
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--dry (-d)" type="boolean">
  Can be used to switch to dry run mode. Dry running codemods helps you see the changes the codemod will make without affecting the project files.

```bash
codemod [codemod name] --dry
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--no-format" type="boolean">
  Can be used to disable prettier formatting to the files affected by the codemod.

```bash
codemod [codemod name] --no-format
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--no-cache" type="boolean">
  Can be used to disable caching downloaded codemod files.

```bash
codemod [codemod name] --no-cache
```

  <Tip>Disabling cache can ensure you are getting the freshest results. While keeping the cache enabled can help you save bandwidth and time for repetitive use of the same codemods.</Tip>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--no-install" type="boolean">
  Can be used to disable dependencies installation after codemod run.

```bash
codemod [codemod name] --no-install
```

  <Warning>Some codemods may install or remove dependencies after running.
  This option allows you to disable that behavior and handle dependency upgrades manually.</Warning>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--no-telemetry" type="boolean">
  Can be used to disable CLI telemetry data collection.

```bash
codemod [codemod name] --no-telemetry
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--json (-j)" type="boolean">
  Can be used to switch the CLI responses to JSON format.

```bash
codemod [codemod name] --json
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--threads (-n)" type="number" default="4">
  Can be used to specify the number of worker threads the CLI uses while running codemods.

```bash
codemod [codemod name] -n [number of threads]
```

</ResponseField>

## Generate codemod from file diff

The `learn` command uses the diff of the latest edited file to automatically build a codemod using [Codemod Studio](/building-codemods/codemod-studio/).

After running this command, if any git diff exists, the Codemod Engine will use the diff as before/after snippets in Codemod Studio.

```bash
codemod learn
```

## Login to Codemod platform

The `login` command can be used to login to Codemod platform.

```bash
codemod login
```

## Logout from Codemod platform

The `logout` command can be used to logout from Codemod platform.

```bash
codemod logout
```

## Creating a codemod package

The `init` command can be used to scaffold a new codemod package.

```bash
codemod init
```

## Building a codemod package

The `build` command can be used to build a JavaScript codemod package. If you are using any of the [supported JavaScript codemod engines](/codemod-registry/publishing-codemods#supported-codemod-engines), you can use the CLI to build the main executable file.

```bash
codemod build
```

## Publishing codemods

The `publish` command can be used to [publish a codemod to the Codemod Registry](/codemod-registry/publishing-codemods). Publishing codemods requires [logging in](#login-to-codemod-platform) to Codemod platform.

```bash
codemod publish
```

## Help commands

<ResponseField name="--help">
  Can be used to show a list of all available commands and options for Codemod CLI.

```bash
codemod --help
```

You can also use this flag in combination with a particular CLI command to display usage information relevant to that command.

```bash
codemod login --help
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--version (-v)">
  Can be used to show the currently active version of Codemod CLI.

```bash
codemod --version
```
