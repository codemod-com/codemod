Publishing your codemods to the Codemod Registry allows you to easily share them with thousands of developers around the world.

Once added, they will automatically integrate with the Codemod platform. This simplifies codemod discovery and distribution, and offers a great developer experience for running codemods.

<Tip>
Publishing codemods to the registry is especially useful for framework/library builders. With features like shareable codemod deep links and Codemod CLI & IDE extenion, your users can adopt your latest releases with one click, straight from your migration doc!

</Tip>

To publish a codemod to the registry, you can either open a pull request with your codemod in the GitHub repository, or you can publish the codemod using Codemod CLI.

## Option 1: Open PR in the GitHub repository

By opening a pull request in the codemod registry's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/codemod-com/codemod/tree/main/apps/registry), your codemod will be automatically published to the codemod registry and made available in the Codemod platform.

<Note>
Before opening a pull request with your codemod, make sure that your codemod conforms to [the structure required by the Codemod platform](https://github.com/codemod-com/codemod/blob/main/apps/registry/codemods/pull_request_template.md).
</Note>

## Option 2: Publish with Codemod CLI
