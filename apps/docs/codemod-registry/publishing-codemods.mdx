Publishing your codemods to the Codemod Registry allows you to easily share them with thousands of developers around the world.

Once added, they will automatically integrate with the Codemod platform. This simplifies codemod discovery and distribution, and offers a great developer experience for running codemods.

<Info>
Publishing codemods to the registry is especially useful for framework/library builders. With features like shareable codemod deep links and Codemod CLI & IDE extenion, your users can adopt your latest releases with one click, straight from your migration doc. <Tooltip tip="MSW V2 migration">[See example ->](https://mswjs.io/docs/migrations/1.x-to-2.x/#codemods)</Tooltip>

## Publish with Codemod CLI

Once you have your [codemod-compatible package](/building-codemods/introduction) ready, you can use Codemod CLI to publish a local codemod to the codemod registry.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login to the Codemod platform">
  Login to the Codemod platform by using:
  
  ```bash
  codemod login
  ```
  
  When logging in, you will be redirected to your generated auth token on the web platform. Simply copy your token and enter it into your terminal to login with Codemod CLI.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build your local project">
  If your local project is not already built, you can build it using codemod CLI:

  ```bash
  codemod build
  ```

  <Note>
  This will build a JavaScript project using `esbuild` and create a `dist` directory in your project root. If your codemod is not using a JavaScript engine, you can skip this step.
  </Note>

  <Tip>
  To build the codemod using codemod CLI, global installation of `esbuild` package is required.
  You can install it using package manager of choice. For example, using `npm`:
  ```bash
  npm install -g esbuild
  ```
  </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish your codemod">
  Publish your codemod by using the following command inside your project's directory:

  ```bash
  codemod publish
  ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
