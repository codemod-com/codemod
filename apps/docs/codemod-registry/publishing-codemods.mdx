You can easily share your codemods with thousands of people around the world by adding them to the Codemod Registry. Once added, they will automatically integrate with Codemod platform. This simplifies codemod discovery and distribution, and offers a better running codemods experience.

<Info>
Publishing codemods to the registry is especially useful for framework/library builders. With features like shareable codemod deep links and Codemod CLI & IDE extenion, your users can adopt your latest releases with one click, straight from your migration doc. <Tooltip tip="MSW V2 migration">[See example ->](https://mswjs.io/docs/migrations/1.x-to-2.x/#codemods)</Tooltip>

## Supported codemod engines

Codemod platform currently supports the following codemod engines: [`ast-grep`](https://github.com/ast-grep/ast-grep), [`filemod`](https://github.com/codemod-com/codemod/tree/main/packages/filemod), [`jscodeshift`](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift), [`ts-morph`](https://github.com/dsherret/ts-morph), and [`piranha`](https://github.com/uber/piranha).

## Required codemod package structure

To make your codemod package compatible with Codemod platform, it needs to have a `.codemodrc.json` configuration file in the project root.

```bash
├── dist
│   ├── index.cjs # this is the default path for the built codemod file. when someone runs your codemod, this file will be executed.
├── src
│   ├── index.ts # this is the default path for the codemod's entry point file.
│   ├── ...
├── .codemodrc.json # contains the codemod configuration
└── README.md # must contain a short description and examples, such as in the example at the bottom of this page
```

  <Accordion title=".codemodrc.json reference">
    
    <ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
      Specifies the slugified name of the codemod published to the codemod registry.
    </ResponseField>
    
    <ResponseField name="version" type="string" required>

      <Warning>The version field must be bumped every time the codemod is published.</Warning>
    </ResponseField>
    
    <ResponseField name="private" type="boolean" default="false">
      Can be used to set the codemod visibility to `private`.

      By default, when a codemod is published without a namespace, visibility will be set as `public`.
      If a codemod is published under a namespace, such as `@codemod/my-codemod`, visibility will be set as `private`.
    </ResponseField>
    
    <ResponseField name="engine" type="string" required>
      Specifies the engine used to run the codemod.
      Can be any of:
      - `filemod`
      - `jscodeshift`
      - `ts-morph`
      - `ast-grep`
      - `piranha` (requires additional `language` field that specifies one of the supported piranha languages:
      `java`, `kt`, `go`, `py`, `swift`, `ts`, `tsx`, or `scala`)
      - `recipe` (requires additional `names` field, which is an ordered array of codemod names that will be executed)
    </ResponseField>
    
    <ResponseField name="include" type="glob pattern array">
      Can be used to override the default glob pattern for files that will be processed by the codemod.
    </ResponseField>
    
    <ResponseField name="applicability" type="object">
      The applicability field is an object with `from` and `to` keys that are both arrays of tuples.
      This field can be used to specify the dependencies and versions this codemod is made for.
      This field is also used to check if the codemod is compatible with the project it will run over.
    
      Each tuple consists of three elements:
      1. a library name
      2. a comparison operator (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `=`)
      3. a version number ([SemVer](https://semver.org/) compatible)
    </ResponseField>
    
    <ResponseField name="deps" type="array of strings">
      Can be used to specify dependencies to be installed after successful a codemod run.
      You can also specify a package to be removed by prepending it with a `-` sign.

      - `-package-name`
      - `package-name`

        <ResponseField name="kind" type="string">
          Specifies the argument argument type. Can be any of: `string`, `number`, or `boolean`.
        </ResponseField>

        <ResponseField name="required" type="boolean">
          Specifies if the argument is required.
        </ResponseField>
      </Expandable>

    </ResponseField>
    
    <ResponseField name="meta" type="object">
      Specifies additional information about your codemod for discoverability purposes.

      <Expandable title="Meta child fields">
        <ResponseField name="tags" type="array of strings">
          Specifies tags for your codemods (ex: next.js, react).
        </ResponseField>

        <ResponseField name="git" type="string">
          Specifies the url to the codemod's repository.
        </ResponseField>
      </Expandable>
    </ResponseField>
    
    <ResponseField name="build" type="object">
      Specifies custom paths for the build input and output files.

## Publish with Codemod CLI

Once your codemod package is [compatible with Codemod platform](#required-codemod-package-structure), you can use Codemod CLI to publish a local codemod to the codemod registry.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login to Codemod platform">
  Login to Codemod platform by using:
  
  ```bash
  codemod login
  ```
  
  When logging in, you will be redirected to your generated auth token on the web platform. Simply copy your token and enter it into your terminal to login with Codemod CLI.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build your local project">
  <Info>
  This will build a JavaScript project using `esbuild` and create a `dist` directory in your project root. If your codemod is not using a JavaScript engine, you can skip this step.
  </Info>
  
  If your local project is not already built, you can build it using codemod CLI:

  1. Install `esbuild` globally (if not installed):
  ```bash
  npm install -g esbuild
  ```
  
  2. Build codemod:
  ```bash
  codemod build
  ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish your codemod">
  Publish your codemod by using the following command inside your project's directory:

  ```bash
  codemod publish
  ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
