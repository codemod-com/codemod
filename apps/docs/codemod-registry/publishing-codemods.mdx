You can easily share your codemods with thousands of people around the world by adding them to the Codemod Registry. Once added, they will automatically integrate with Codemod platform. This simplifies codemod discovery and distribution, and offers a better running codemods experience.

<Info>
Publishing codemods to the registry is especially useful for framework/library builders. With features like shareable codemod deep links and Codemod CLI & IDE extenion, your users can adopt your latest releases with one click, straight from your migration doc. <Tooltip tip="MSW V2 migration">[See example ->](https://mswjs.io/docs/migrations/1.x-to-2.x/#codemods)</Tooltip>

## Supported codemod engines

Codemod platform currently supports the following codemod engines: [`ast-grep`](https://github.com/ast-grep/ast-grep), [`filemod`](https://github.com/codemod-com/codemod/tree/main/packages/filemod), [`jscodeshift`](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift), [`ts-morph`](https://github.com/dsherret/ts-morph), and [`piranha`](https://github.com/uber/piranha).

## Required codemod package structure

To make your codemod package compatible with Codemod platform, it needs to have a `.codemodrc.json` configuration file in the project root and conform to one of the structures, depending on the codemod engine used.


<Accordion title=".codemodrc.json reference">
  
  <ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
    Specifies the slugified name of the codemod published to the codemod registry.
  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="version" type="string" required>
    Specifies the current codemod version. Should follow the [SemVer scheme](https://semver.org/).
    <Warning>The version field must be bumped every time the codemod is published.</Warning>
  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="private" type="boolean" default="false">
    Can be used to set the codemod visibility to `private`.

    By default, when a codemod is published without a namespace, visibility will be set as `public`.
    If a codemod is published under a namespace, such as `@codemod/my-codemod`, visibility will be set as `private`.
  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="engine" type="string" required>
    Specifies the engine used to run the codemod.
    Can be any of:
    - `filemod`
    - `jscodeshift`
    - `ts-morph`
    - `ast-grep`
    - `piranha` (requires additional `language` field that specifies one of the supported piranha languages:
    `java`, `kt`, `go`, `py`, `swift`, `ts`, `tsx`, or `scala`)
    - `recipe` (requires additional `names` field, which is an ordered array of codemod names that will be executed)
  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="include" type="glob pattern array">
    Can be used to override the default glob pattern for files that will be processed by the codemod.
  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="applicability" type="object">
    The applicability field is an object with `from` and `to` keys that are both arrays of tuples.
    This field can be used to specify the dependencies and versions this codemod is made for.
    
    Specifying the applicability criteria of your codemod helps:
    1. Reduce false positives
    2. Proactively recommend the codemod to users who might need it
    3. Improve codemod performance, as it will only process projects that make sense
    4. Allow daisy-chaining codemods (e.g., migrating from v1 to v3 by combining v1-to-v2 and v2-to-v3 codemods)
  
    Each tuple consists of three elements:
    1. a library name
    2. a comparison operator (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `=`)
    3. a version number ([SemVer](https://semver.org/) compatible)
  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="deps" type="array of strings">
    Can be used to specify dependencies to be installed after successful a codemod run.
    You can also specify a package to be removed by prepending it with a `-` sign.
    Each dependency should be a string in one of the following formats:
    - `package-name@version`
    - `-package-name`
    - `package-name`
  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="arguments" type="array of objects">
    If your codemod requires arguments, you can specify them in this field.

    <Expandable title="Argument fields">
      <ResponseField name="name" type="string">
        Specifies the argument name.
      </ResponseField>

      <ResponseField name="description" type="string">
        Specifies the argument description.
      </ResponseField>

      <ResponseField name="kind" type="string">
        Specifies the argument argument type. Can be any of: `string`, `number`, or `boolean`.
      </ResponseField>

      <ResponseField name="required" type="boolean">
        Specifies if the argument is required.
      </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>

  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="meta" type="object">
    Specifies additional information about your codemod for discoverability purposes.

    <Expandable title="Meta child fields">
      <ResponseField name="tags" type="array of strings">
        Specifies tags for your codemods (ex: next.js, react).
      </ResponseField>

      <ResponseField name="git" type="string">
        Specifies the url to the codemod's repository.
      </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>
  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="build" type="object">
    Specifies custom paths for the build input and output files.

    <Expandable title="Build child fields">
      <ResponseField name="input" type="string">
        Specifies the path to the input file.
      </ResponseField>

      <ResponseField name="output" type="string">
        Specifies the path to the output file.
      </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>

## Publish with Codemod CLI

Once your codemod package is [compatible with Codemod platform](#required-codemod-package-structure), you can use Codemod CLI to publish a local codemod to the codemod registry.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login to Codemod platform">
  Login to Codemod platform by using:
  
  ```bash
  codemod login
  ```
  
  You will be redirected to the Codemod platform login page. Upon successful login, our CLI will automatically authenticate you.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build your local project">

  <Note>
  This will build a JavaScript project using `esbuild` and create a `dist` directory in your project root. If your codemod is not using a JavaScript engine, you can skip this step.
  </Note>

  If your local project is not already built, you can build it using codemod CLI:

  ```bash
  codemod build
  ```

  <Accordion title="Error: The package `esbuild` could not be found.">
    This step requires requires global `esbuild` package installation. `esbuild` is installed by default while [installing Codemod CLI](/deploying-codemods/cli#installation). If you get an error saying "The package `esbuild` could not be found." try installing it manually by running `npm install -g esbuild`.
  </Accordion>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish your codemod">
  Publish your codemod by using the following command inside your project's directory:

  ```bash
  codemod publish
  ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
