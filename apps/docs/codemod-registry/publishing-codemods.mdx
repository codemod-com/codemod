Publishing your codemods to the Codemod Registry allows you to easily share them with thousands of developers around the world.

Once added, they will automatically integrate with the Codemod platform. This simplifies codemod discovery and distribution, and offers a great developer experience for running codemods.

<Info>
Publishing codemods to the registry is especially useful for framework/library builders. With features like shareable codemod deep links and Codemod CLI & IDE extenion, your users can adopt your latest releases with one click, straight from your migration doc. <Tooltip tip="MSW V2 migration">[See example ->](https://mswjs.io/docs/migrations/1.x-to-2.x/#codemods)</Tooltip>

<Tip>
Before publishing your codemod, make sure that your codemod conforms to [the structure required by the Codemod platform](https://github.com/codemod-com/codemod/blob/main/packages/codemods/pull_request_template.md).

The easiest way to do this is by placing your codemod in [Codemod Studio](https://codemod.studio) and then clicking "Export Locally" to download a registry-compatible local codemod.
