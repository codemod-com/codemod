[Codemod Registry](https://codemod.com/registry) is a centralized hub for discovering and sharing both traditional and next-gen LLM-powered codemods ([codemod2.0](/building-codemods/codemod2#step-6-publish-the-codemod)), making them easily accessible to developers regardless of the engine used.

Developers can create codemods using engines like [ast-grep](https://ast-grep.github.io/), [jscodeshift](https://jscodeshift.com/overview/introduction/), [recipe](https://github.com/codemod-com/codemod/blob/main/packages/codemods/react/19/migration-recipe/.codemodrc.json), and [ts-morph](https://ts-morph.com/), and publish them directly to the registry for global distribution.

Published codemods are accessible via [web](https://codemod.com/registry) and [CLI](/deploying-codemods/cli#share-discover), with public codemods available to everyone and private ones restricted to an organizationâ€™s team. 

Codemods with a green badge are officially approved by project owners (e.g., Node.js, React), to offer developers a trustworthy resource with analytics like run counts to identify the best codemods they for their needs.
