[Codemod Registry](https://go.codemod.com/registry) is an open-source, single-stop repository for codemods and code automation recipes that are built on top of tried-and-true engines such as Meta's jscodeshift, ts-morph, and Uber's piranha.

After [publishing codemods](/codemod-registry/publishing-codemods) to the registry, they will automatically integrate into the Codemod platform and all developers who have the Codemod [CLI](/deploying-codemods/cli) or [IDE extension](/deploying-codemods/vsce) can then discover, share, and run those codemods with a single click. This also eliminates the need for installing additional packages for each framework they want to upgrade.
