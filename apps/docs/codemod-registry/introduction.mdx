Codemod Registry is the single-stop registry for codemods and code automation recipes that are built on top of tried-and-true engines such as Meta's jscodeshift, ts-morph, and Uber's piranha.

After [publishing codemods](/deploying-codemods/cli#codemod-publish) to the registry, they will automatically integrate into Codemod platform and all developers who have Codemod [CLI](/deploying-codemods/cli-overview) or [IDE extension](/deploying-codemods/vsce) can then discover, share, and run those codemods with a single click. This also eliminates the need for installing additional packages for each framework they want to upgrade.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion
  title="Supported codemod engines"
>
  Codemod platform currently supports the following codemod engines: [`ast-grep`](https://github.com/ast-grep/ast-grep), [`filemod`](https://github.com/codemod-com/codemod/tree/main/packages/filemod), [`jscodeshift`](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift), [`ts-morph`](https://github.com/dsherret/ts-morph), and [`piranha`](https://github.com/uber/piranha).
</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="Required codemod package structure"
>
  To publish your codemod to Codemod Registry, it needs to have a `.codemodrc.json` configuration file in the project root and conform to one of the structures, depending on the codemod engine used.

<Note>
  If your codemod does not have a `.codemodrc.json` file, Codemod CLI will ask you a few questions about your codemod and generate the configuration file automatically for you.
</Note>


<Accordion title=".codemodrc.json reference">
  
  <ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
    Specifies the slugified name of the codemod published to the codemod registry.
  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="version" type="string" required>
    Specifies the current codemod version. Should follow the [SemVer scheme](https://semver.org/).
    <Warning>The version field must be bumped every time the codemod is published.</Warning>
  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="private" type="boolean" default="false">
    Can be used to set the codemod visibility to `private`.

    By default, when a codemod is published without a namespace, visibility will be set as `public`.
    If a codemod is published under a namespace, such as `@codemod/my-codemod`, visibility will be set as `private`.
  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="engine" type="string" required>
    Specifies the engine used to run the codemod.
    Can be any of:
    - `filemod`
    - `jscodeshift`
    - `ts-morph`
    - `ast-grep`
    - `piranha` (requires additional `language` field that specifies one of the supported piranha languages:
    `java`, `kt`, `go`, `py`, `swift`, `ts`, `tsx`, or `scala`)
    - `recipe` (requires additional `names` field, which is an ordered array of codemod names that will be executed)
  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="include" type="glob pattern array">
    Can be used to override the default glob pattern for files that will be processed by the codemod.
  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="applicability" type="object">
    The applicability field is an object with `from` and `to` keys that are both arrays of tuples.
    This field can be used to specify the dependencies and versions this codemod is made for.
    
    Specifying the applicability criteria of your codemod helps:
    1. Reduce false positives
    2. Proactively recommend the codemod to users who might need it
    3. Improve codemod performance, as it will only process projects that make sense
    4. Allow daisy-chaining codemods (e.g., migrating from v1 to v3 by combining v1-to-v2 and v2-to-v3 codemods)
  
    Each tuple consists of three elements:
    1. a library name
    2. a comparison operator (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `=`)
    3. a version number ([SemVer](https://semver.org/) compatible)
  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="deps" type="array of strings">
    Can be used to specify dependencies to be installed after successful a codemod run.
    You can also specify a package to be removed by prepending it with a `-` sign.
    Each dependency should be a string in one of the following formats:
    - `package-name@version`
    - `-package-name`
    - `package-name`
  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="arguments" type="array of objects">
    If your codemod requires arguments, you can specify them in this field.

    <Expandable title="Argument fields">
      <ResponseField name="name" type="string">
        Specifies the argument name.
      </ResponseField>

      <ResponseField name="description" type="string">
        Specifies the argument description.
      </ResponseField>

      <ResponseField name="kind" type="string">
        Specifies the argument argument type. Can be any of: `string`, `number`, or `boolean`.
      </ResponseField>

      <ResponseField name="required" type="boolean">
        Specifies if the argument is required.
      </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>

  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="meta" type="object">
    Specifies additional information about your codemod for discoverability purposes.

    <Expandable title="Meta child fields">
      <ResponseField name="tags" type="array of strings">
        Specifies tags for your codemods (ex: next.js, react).
      </ResponseField>

      <ResponseField name="git" type="string">
        Specifies the url to the codemod's repository.
      </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>
  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="build" type="object">
    Specifies custom paths for the build input and output files.

    <Expandable title="Build child fields">
      <ResponseField name="input" type="string">
        Specifies the path to the input file.
      </ResponseField>

      <ResponseField name="output" type="string">
        Specifies the path to the output file.
      </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>
  </ResponseField>
