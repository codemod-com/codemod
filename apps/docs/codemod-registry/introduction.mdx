[Codemod Registry](https://codemod.com/registry) is a centralized hub for discovering and sharing codemods, making them easily accessible to open-source communities and teams of any size.

Developers can [create codemods](/platform/build) using engines like [ast-grep (recommended)](https://ast-grep.github.io/), [jscodeshift](https://jscodeshift.com/overview/introduction/), and [ts-morph](https://ts-morph.com/), and publish them directly to the registry for global distribution.

Published codemods are accessible via [web](https://codemod.com/registry) and [CLI](/deploying-codemods/cli#share-discover), with public codemods available to everyone and private ones restricted to an organization's team. 

Codemods with a green badge are officially approved by project owners (e.g., Node.js, React), to offer developers a trustworthy resource with analytics like run counts to identify the best codemods they for their needs. If you are a framework/library builder or maintainer and would like to streamline your users' migration process, please get in touch with us via [Slack](https://go.codemod.com/community) or [our contact page](https://codemod.com/contact).
