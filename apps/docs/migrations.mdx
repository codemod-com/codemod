Migration Campaigns let engineering teams orchestrate sweeping code changes—framework upgrades, API refactors, or dependency clean-ups—across any number of repositories.

By combining Codemod’s AI-powered runbooks with deterministic automations, campaigns dramatically lower migration cost and risk while giving you full visibility into progress.

<Tip>
  Migration Campaigns are designed for [enterprise](https://codemod.com/pricing) engingeering teams. To start a new migration campaign, simply [get in touch with us](https://go.codemod.com/contact) and we'll add the requested migration to your dashboard.

## Running a Migration Campaign

<Frame>

<Tip>
  Make sure the <a href="https://github.com/apps/codemod/installations/select_target">Codemod GitHub App</a> is installed on repositories you plan to migrate.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Migration Campaigns">
    In the Codemod app, navigate to **Campaigns -> Create Workflow**.

    <Note>
      The Campaigns section is visible only on [pro tier or above](https://codemod.com/pricing) or upon [request](https://go.codemod.com/contact).
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create campaign">
    Give your campaign a descriptive name and pick the repositories you wish to target.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define workflow">
    Compose one or more steps—codemods, scripts, or manual approvals—into a repeatable workflow that Codemod will run for every affected repo.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run & track">
    Start the campaign and watch progress roll in. Codemod opens pull-requests, tracks status, and surfaces metrics so you always know what’s left.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating custom workflows

While a campaign may be as simple as a single automated codemod, most migrations involve a sequence of steps. You can design those steps by building [Codemod Workflows](/cli/workflows). Alternatively, pro and enterprise customers can request custom workflows by [contacting us](https://go.codemod.com/contact).
