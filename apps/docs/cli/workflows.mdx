Codemod Workflow is an open-source orchestrator, scheduler, and runner for multi-step code transformations. Run it locally via Codemod CLI.
It lets you break down migrations into atomic steps, each powered by codemods, CLI commands, custom scripts, or other primitives.

Built for reusability, reliability, flexibility, and scale:

- **Single binary, no server** — works anywhere you have a shell
- **Schema-validated shared state** — tasks share one JSON document
- **Dynamic matrix fan-out** — tasks appear/disappear as state arrays change
- **Manual gates** — pause tasks until you trigger them
- **Durable & resumable** — state survives crashes or reboots
- **Parallel scheduling** — independent nodes run when dependencies allow
- **Host-shell execution** — commands run directly on your machine (container runtimes on the roadmap)

Codemod Workflows can be run using [Codemod CLI](/cli/cli-reference) or [Codemod Platform](/migrations).

</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new codemod project">
    ```bash
    npx codemod init
    ```

    When creating a new codemod project, you'll be prompted for:

    - **Project directory**
    - **Codemod type:**
      - Shell command workflow codemod
      - JavaScript ast-grep codemod
      - YAML ast-grep codemod
    - **Project name**
    - **Description**
    - **Author**
    - **License type**
    - **If your codemod is private**

    This will create a new folder with all the necessary files and structure for your chosen codemod type.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore the generated project">
    The generated project structure will differ depending on the codemod type you select:

    <Info>
      You can combine different codemod types in a single package by placing each type under its required directory (e.g., <code>
      scripts/</code>

       for shell scripts,<code>
      rules/</code>

       for ast-grep rules) and referencing them from <code>
      workflow.yaml</code>

      . This allows you to orchestrate complex, multi-step migrations using the best tool for each job.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understand an example workflow">
    The generated `workflow.yaml` will also differ depending on the codemod type you select:

      You can combine different codemod types in a single package by placing each type under its required directory (e.g., `scripts/` for shell scripts, `rules/` for ast-grep rules) and referencing them from `workflow.yaml`. This allows you to orchestrate complex, multi-step migrations using the best tool for each job.

  <Step title="Validate & run your workflow">
    ```bash
    npx codemod workflow validate -w workflow.yaml
    npx codemod workflow run -w workflow.yaml
    ```

    This will check your workflow for errors and then run it locally.

    <Info>
      The `workflow validate` command checks syntax and schema compliance, but not logical correctness. Always test your workflows with real data to ensure they behave as expected.

## Directory Layout

```
my-workflow/
├─ workflow.yaml
├─ scripts/
└─ rules/
```

The folder—called a **workflow bundle**—is the root when you run `npx codemod workflow run ./my-workflow/`. `$CODEMOD_PATH` points here inside every task.

<Accordion title="Workflow Bundle & Loading Workflows">
  A workflow bundle is a directory containing your `workflow.yaml` and any scripts, rules, or assets referenced by your workflow.

  - When you run

    ```bash
    npx codemod workflow run ./my-workflow/
    ```

    the directory is used as the root for all relative paths.
  - You can also run a workflow directly from a file:

    <br />

    ```bash
    npx codemod workflow run -w workflow.yaml
    ```

  <Info>
    Registry support (run workflows from remote sources) is planned for the future.
  </Info>
</Accordion>

## Workflow File

```yaml workflow.yaml
version: "1"
state:
  schema: []
templates: []
nodes: []
```

A workflow has four top-level keys:

| Key                       | Required | Purpose                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`                 | ✓        | Declare workflow schema version (default: `"1"`). |
| [`state`](#shared-state)  |          | Declares shared-state schema.                     |
| [`templates`](#templates) |          | Re-usable blocks.                                 |
| [`nodes`](#nodes)         | ✓        | Executable DAG.                                   |

---

## Shared State

```yaml
version: "1"
state:
  schema:
    - name: shards
      type: array
      items:
        type: object
        properties:
          team:    { type: string }
          shardId: { type: string }
nodes: []
```

---

## Templates

```yaml
version: "1"
templates:
  - id: checkout-repo
    name: Checkout Repository
    inputs:
      - name: repo_url
        type: string
        required: true
    steps:
      - name: Clone
        run: git clone ${{inputs.repo_url}} repo
```

**Template Inputs & Usage**:

Templates can define required or optional inputs, which are referenced in their steps.

<Info>
  Template usage in node steps is planned for future releases. For now, templates serve as reusable workflow components that can be referenced in documentation and examples.
</Info>

---

## Nodes & Steps

### Nodes

```yaml
version: "1"
nodes:
  - id: build
    name: Build

## Matrix Strategy

```yaml
version: "1"
state:
  schema:
    - name: shards
      type: array
      items:
        type: object
        properties:
          team: { type: string }
          shardId: { type: string }
nodes:
  - id: matrix-codemod
    name: Matrix Codemod
    strategy:
      type: matrix
      from_state: shards
    steps:
      - name: Codemod
        run: node codemod.js --team=$team --shard=$shardId
```

<Accordion title="Dynamic Matrix Task Recompilation">
  When the array referenced by `from_state` changes, Codemod CLI:

  1. Creates new tasks for new items.
  2. Marks tasks as `WontDo` if their item is removed.
  3. Leaves existing tasks untouched if their item remains.

  <Info>
    Matrix nodes have a **master task** that tracks the status of all generated tasks.
  </Info>
</Accordion>

---

## Manual Trigger

```yaml
version: "1"
nodes:
  - id: manual-approval
    name: Manual Approval
    trigger:
      type: manual
    steps:
      - name: Wait for approval
        run: echo "Waiting for manual approval"
```

<Accordion title="Task UUIDs & Resume">
  Manual tasks are assigned unique UUIDs. You can resume:

  - All paused tasks:

    ```bash
    npx codemod workflow resume -i <run-id> --trigger-all
    ```
  - A specific task:

    ```bash
    npx codemod workflow resume -i <run-id> -t <task-uuid>
    ```
</Accordion>

## State Updates

| Syntax       | Meaning                            | Example                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `KEY=VAL`    | Set state key to value             | `count=10`                              |
| `KEY@=VAL`   | Append value to array at state key | `shards@={"team":"core","shardId":"1"}` |
| Dot notation | Set nested state fields            | `config.retries=5`                      |
| JSON values  | Use valid JSON for objects/arrays  | `user={"name":"Alice","id":123}`        |

<Info>
  All state updates must be valid JSON if not a primitive. Updates are applied only if the task exits successfully.
</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Container Runtimes">
    Planned feature: containerized execution (e.g., Docker/Podman). Currently, workflows run in the host shell. When available, you'll be able to specify a runtime per node or template.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="State Management & Persistence">
    <Info>
      Workflow state is persisted after every task. If interrupted, you can resume from the last saved state—no work is lost.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Matrix Master Task">
    For matrix nodes, a master task aggregates the status of all generated tasks.\
    If all child tasks complete, the master is `Completed`. If any fail, the master is `Failed`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cyclic Dependency Example">
    If your workflow has a cycle:

    ```yaml
    nodes:
      - id: a
        name: Task A
        depends_on: [b]
        steps:
          - name: Task A
            run: echo "Task A"
      - id: b
        name: Task B
        depends_on: [a]
        steps:
          - name: Task B
            run: echo "Task B"
    ```

    You'll see:

    ```bash
    ✗ Workflow definition is invalid
    Error: Cyclic dependency detected: a → b → a
    ```

    <Info>
      This error is shown when you run `npx codemod workflow validate` or `npx codemod workflow run` on a workflow with a cyclic dependency.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Workflow Orchestration (Matrix + Manual)">
    This comprehensive workflow demonstrates state management, templates, matrix strategies, and manual triggers:

    ```yaml
    version: "1"
    state:
      schema:
        - name: shards
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              team: { type: string }
              shardId: { type: string }
    templates:
      - id: checkout-repo
        name: Checkout Repository
        inputs:
          - name: repo_url
            type: string
            required: true
        steps:
          - name: Clone
            run: git clone ${{inputs.repo_url}} repo
    nodes:
      - id: make-shards
        name: Make Shards
        type: automatic
        steps:
          - name: Write shards
            run: echo 'shards@={"team":"core","shardId":"1"}' >> "$STATE_OUTPUTS"
      - id: matrix-codemod
        name: Matrix Codemod
        strategy:
          type: matrix
          from_state: shards
        trigger:
          type: manual
        steps:
          - name: Codemod
            run: node codemod.js --team=$team --shard=$shardId
          - name: PR
            run: codemodctl pr create
    ```

    **What this workflow does:**

    1. **State Management**: Defines a `shards` array to store team and shard information
    2. **Template Reuse**: Creates a reusable `checkout-repo` template for cloning repositories
    3. **Dynamic State**: The `make-shards` node populates the state with shard data
    4. **Matrix Execution**: The `matrix-codemod` node creates parallel tasks for each shard
    5. **Manual Gates**: Requires approval before running the codemod on each shard
    6. **Multi-step Tasks**: Each matrix task runs both the codemod and creates a PR
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Migration Recipes">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Scaffold a new workflow package">
        ```bash
        npx codemod init migration-recipe
        cd migration-recipe
        ```

        When prompted, choose a `Shell command workflow codemod`.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Populate package manifest (codemod.yaml)">
        ```yaml codemod.yaml
        name: @your-scope/migration-recipe
        version: 1.0.0
        workflow: "workflow.yaml"
        ```

        This links your package to the workflow definition.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Author the recipe workflow (workflow.yaml)">
        Chain Registry codemods as ordered steps. Use npx to call packages. Keep it minimal:

        ```yaml workflow.yaml
        version: "1"
        nodes:
          - id: migrate
            name: Migration Recipe
            type: automatic
            steps:
              - name: Step 1
                run: npx -y codemod@latest <registry-package-1> -t /abs/path/to/repo
              - name: Step 2
                run: npx -y codemod@latest <registry-package-2> -t /abs/path/to/repo
        ```

        Notes:
        - Replace `<registry-package-1>` and `<registry-package-2>` with names from the Registry.
        - Pin versions by suffixing `@<version>`.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Validate the workflow">
        ```bash
        npx codemod workflow validate -w ./workflow.yaml
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Run the recipe on a repo">
        Pass a target path:

        ```bash
        npx codemod workflow run -w ./workflow.yaml -t /abs/path/to/repo
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="(Optional) Publish and run from the Registry">
        ```bash
        # Publish from the package directory
        npx codemod publish

        # Later, run anywhere (use -t for target)
        npx codemod @your-scope/migration-recipe -t /abs/path/to/repo
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Tips">
        - For packages that require the legacy runner, call: `npx codemod@legacy <name> --target <path>`
        - Order matters: steps run top-to-bottom.
        - Use `env:` at the node/step if environment variables are required.
