import { CLIDemo } from "/snippets/cli-demo.mdx";

Codemod Workflows are self-hostable automations designed for running large-scale code transformation jobs.

## Core Features

- **Single binary, no server** — works anywhere you have a shell
- **Schema-validated shared state** — tasks share one JSON document
- **Dynamic matrix fan-out** — tasks appear/disappear as state arrays change
- **Manual gates** — pause tasks until you trigger them
- **Durable & resumable** — state survives crashes or reboots
- **Parallel scheduling** — independent nodes run when dependencies allow
- **Host-shell execution** — commands run directly on your machine (container runtimes on the roadmap)

Codemod Workflows can be run using [Codemod CLI](/cli/cli-reference) or [Codemod Platform](/platform/workflows).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new codemod project">
    ```bash
    npx codemod@next init
    ```

    When creating a new codemod project, you'll be prompted for:

    - **Project directory**
    - **Codemod type:**
      - Shell command workflow codemod
      - JavaScript ast-grep codemod
      - YAML ast-grep codemod
    - **Project name**
    - **Description**
    - **Author**
    - **License type**
    - **If your codemod is private**

    This will create a new folder with all the necessary files and structure for your chosen codemod type.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore the generated project">
    The generated project structure will differ depending on the codemod type you select:

    <Info>
      You can combine different codemod types in a single package by placing each type under its required directory (e.g., <code>
      scripts/</code>

       for shell scripts, <code>
      rules/</code>

       for ast-grep rules) and referencing them from <code>
      workflow.yaml</code>

      . This allows you to orchestrate complex, multi-step migrations using the best tool for each job.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understand an example workflow">
    The generated `workflow.yaml` will also differ depending on the codemod type you select:

    <Info>
      You can combine different codemod types in a single package by placing each type under its required directory (e.g., <code>
      scripts/</code>

       for shell scripts, <code>

      . This allows you to orchestrate complex, multi-step migrations using the best tool for each job.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understand an example workflow">
    The generated `workflow.yaml` (when you choose the YAML-based ast-grep codemod for JavaScript/TypeScript) defines a simple workflow that applies an ast-grep rule to all TypeScript files in the `src/` directory (excluding test files):

    ```yaml
    version: "1"
    nodes:
      - id: apply-rules
        name: Apply ast-grep Rules
        steps:
          - name: "Scan TypeScript files only"
            ast-grep:
              include:
                - "**/*.ts"
                - "**/*.tsx"
              exclude:
                - "**/*.test.ts"
                - "**/*.spec.ts"
              base_path: "src"
              config_file: "rules/config.yml"
    ```

    The referenced `rules/config.yml` contains an example rule:

    ```yaml
    id: replace-console-log
    language: javascript
    rule:
      any:
        - pattern: console.log($ARG)
        - pattern: console.debug($ARG)
    fix:
      logger.log($ARG)
    ```

    This rule will replace all `console.log(...)` and `console.debug(...)` calls with `logger.log(...)` in your TypeScript/JavaScript files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate & run your workflow">
    ```bash
    npx codemod@next workflow validate -w workflow.yaml
    npx codemod@next workflow run -w workflow.yaml
    ```

    This will check your workflow for errors and then run it locally.

    <Info>
      The `workflow validate` command checks syntax and schema compliance, but not logical correctness. Always test your workflows with real data to ensure they behave as expected.

      Learn more about validating workflows [here](/cli/cli-reference#workflow-validate).
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Directory Layout

```
my-workflow/
├─ workflow.yaml
├─ scripts/
└─ rules/
```

The folder—called a **workflow bundle**—is the root when you run `npx codemod@next workflow run ./my-workflow/`. `$CODEMOD_PATH` points here inside every task.

<Accordion title="Workflow Bundle & Loading Workflows">
  A workflow bundle is a directory containing your `workflow.yaml` and any scripts, rules, or assets referenced by your workflow.

  - When you run
    ```bash
    npx codemod@next workflow run ./my-workflow/
    ```

    , the directory is used as the root for all relative paths.
  - You can also run a workflow directly from a file:

    <br />

    ```bash
    npx codemod@next workflow run -w workflow.yaml
    ```

  <Info>
    Registry support (run workflows from remote sources) is planned for the future.
  </Info>
</Accordion>

## Workflow File

```yaml workflow.yaml
version: "1"
state:
  schema: []
templates: []
nodes: []
```

A workflow has four top-level keys:

| Key                       | Required | Purpose                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`                 | ✓        | Declare workflow schema version (default: `"1"`). |
| [`state`](#shared-state)  |          | Declares shared-state schema.                     |
| [`templates`](#templates) |          | Re-usable blocks.                                 |
| [`nodes`](#nodes)         | ✓        | Executable DAG.                                   |

---

## Shared State

```yaml
version: "1"
state:
  schema:
    - name: shards
      type: array
      items:
        type: object
        properties:
          team:    { type: string }
          shardId: { type: string }
nodes: []
```

---

## Templates

```yaml
version: "1"
templates:
  - id: checkout-repo
    name: Checkout Repository
    inputs:
      - name: repo_url
        type: string
        required: true
    steps:
      - name: Clone
        run: git clone ${{inputs.repo_url}} repo
```

**Template Inputs & Usage**:

Templates can define required or optional inputs, which are referenced in their steps.

<Info>
  Template usage in node steps is planned for future releases. For now, templates serve as reusable workflow components that can be referenced in documentation and examples.
</Info>

---

## Nodes & Steps

### Nodes

```yaml
version: "1"
nodes:
  - id: build
    name: Build
    type: automatic
    steps:
      - name: npm install

</ParamField>

## Matrix Strategy

```yaml
version: "1"
state:
  schema:
    - name: shards
      type: array
      items:
        type: object
        properties:
          team: { type: string }
          shardId: { type: string }
nodes:
  - id: matrix-codemod
    name: Matrix Codemod
    strategy:
      type: matrix
      from_state: shards
    steps:
      - name: Codemod
        run: node codemod.js --team=$team --shard=$shardId
```

<Accordion title="Dynamic Matrix Task Recompilation">
  When the array referenced by `from_state` changes, Codemod CLI:

  1. Creates new tasks for new items.
  2. Marks tasks as `WontDo` if their item is removed.
  3. Leaves existing tasks untouched if their item remains.

  <Info>
    Matrix nodes have a <b>
    master task</b>

     that tracks the status of all generated tasks.
  </Info>
</Accordion>

---

## Manual Trigger

```yaml
version: "1"
nodes:
  - id: manual-approval
    name: Manual Approval
    trigger:
      type: manual
    steps:
      - name: Wait for approval
        run: echo "Waiting for manual approval"
```

<Accordion title="Task UUIDs & Resume">
  Manual tasks are assigned unique UUIDs. You can resume:

  - All paused tasks:

    ```bash
    npx codemod@next workflow resume -i <run-id> --trigger-all
    ```
  - A specific task:

    ```bash
    npx codemod@next workflow resume -i <run-id> -t <task-uuid>
    ```
</Accordion>

---

## State Updates

| Syntax       | Meaning                            | Example                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `KEY=VAL`    | Set state key to value             | `count=10`                              |
| `KEY@=VAL`   | Append value to array at state key | `shards@={"team":"core","shardId":"1"}` |
| Dot notation | Set nested state fields            | `config.retries=5`                      |
| JSON values  | Use valid JSON for objects/arrays  | `user={"name":"Alice","id":123}`        |

<Info>
  All state updates must be valid JSON if not a primitive. Updates are applied only if the task exits successfully.
</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Container Runtimes">
    You can specify how a node or template runs:

    ```yaml
    runtime:
      type: docker
      image: node:18-alpine
    ```

    Supported types: `docker`, `podman`, `direct` (host shell).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="State Management & Persistence">
    <Info>
      Workflow state is persisted after every task. If interrupted, you can resume from the last saved state—no work is lost.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Matrix Master Task">
    For matrix nodes, a master task aggregates the status of all generated tasks.\
    If all child tasks complete, the master is `Completed`. If any fail, the master is `Failed`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cyclic Dependency Example">
    If your workflow has a cycle:

    ```yaml
    nodes:
      - id: a
        name: Task A
        depends_on: [b]
        steps:
          - name: Task A
            run: echo "Task A"
      - id: b
        name: Task B
        depends_on: [a]
        steps:
          - name: Task B
            run: echo "Task B"
    ```

    You'll see:

    ```bash
    ✗ Workflow definition is invalid
    Error: Cyclic dependency detected: a → b → a
    ```

    <Info>
      This error is shown when you run `npx codemod@next workflow validate` or `npx codemod@next workflow run` on a workflow with a cyclic dependency.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## End-to-End Example

This comprehensive workflow demonstrates state management, templates, matrix strategies, and manual triggers:

```yaml
version: "1"
state:
  schema:
    - name: shards
      type: array
      items:
        type: object
        properties:
          team: { type: string }
          shardId: { type: string }
templates:
  - id: checkout-repo
    name: Checkout Repository
    inputs:
      - name: repo_url
        type: string
        required: true
    steps:
      - name: Clone
        run: git clone ${{inputs.repo_url}} repo
nodes:
  - id: make-shards
    name: Make Shards
    type: automatic
    steps:
      - name: Write shards
        run: echo 'shards@={"team":"core","shardId":"1"}' >> "$STATE_OUTPUTS"
  - id: matrix-codemod
    name: Matrix Codemod
    strategy:
      type: matrix
      from_state: shards
    trigger:
      type: manual
    steps:
      - name: Codemod
        run: node codemod.js --team=$team --shard=$shardId
      - name: PR
        run: codemodctl pr create
```

**What this workflow does:**

1. **State Management**: Defines a `shards` array to store team and shard information
2. **Template Reuse**: Creates a reusable `checkout-repo` template for cloning repositories
3. **Dynamic State**: The `make-shards` node populates the state with shard data
4. **Matrix Execution**: The `matrix-codemod` node creates parallel tasks for each shard
5. **Manual Gates**: Requires approval before running the codemod on each shard
6. **Multi-step Tasks**: Each matrix task runs both the codemod and creates a PR
