title: "React 18 to 19 Migration"
---

React 19 introduces several new features and improvements, including:

1. **Actions**: Automate handling of pending states, errors, forms, and optimistic updates using new hooks like `useTransition` and `useActionState`.
2. **New API: `use`**: Read resources in render, supporting conditional calls and promises.
3. **Server Components and Server Actions**: Enable async functions on the server, improving performance.
4. **Improved Hydration**: Better error reporting and compatibility with third-party scripts.
5. **Enhanced Ref Handling**: Simplified ref access and cleanup functions.

For more details, check out [what's new in React 19](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19).

Codemod supports a mostly automated React 19 upgrade experience. This page provides tips and resources you may need for a successful migration.

## Migration Steps
<Steps>
    <Step title="Installation">
    Install the latest version of React and React DOM:
    ```bash
    npm install --save-exact react@rc react-dom@rc
    ```

    or, if youâ€™re using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn add --exact react@rc react-dom@rc
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Update types (Optional - TypeScript only)">
        If you're using TypeScript, you also need to update the types. Once React 19 is released as stable, you can install the types as usual from `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom`.  Until the stable release, the types are available in different packages which need to be enforced in your `package.json`:

        ```json package.json
        {
        "dependencies": {
            "@types/react": "npm:types-react@rc",
            "@types/react-dom": "npm:types-react-dom@rc"
        },
        "overrides": {
            "@types/react": "npm:types-react@rc",
            "@types/react-dom": "npm:types-react-dom@rc"
        }
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run codemods">
    Run the React 19 upgrade recipe:

    ```bash
    npx codemod@latest react/19/migration-recipe
    ```

    This recipe is a set of codemods that will fix some of React 19 breaking changes.  

    The recipe includes the following codemods:

    - [react/19/replace-reactdom-render](https://codemod.com/registry/react-19-replace-reactdom-render)
    - [react/19/replace-string-ref](https://codemod.com/registry/react-19-replace-string-ref)
    - [react/19/replace-act-import](https://codemod.com/registry/react-19-replace-act-import)
    - [react/19/replace-use-form-state](https://codemod.com/registry/react-19-replace-use-form-state)
    - [react/prop-types-typescript](https://codemod.com/registry/react-prop-types-typescript)

    For a list of all available codemods, see the [`react-codemod` repo](https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod).
