Codemod Studio allows you to create, analyze, and improve code automation bots with the help of Codemod AI. Codemod AI is an innovative tool designed to streamline the process of creating codemods using before and after examples.

By leveraging advanced AI technologies and deterministic software engineering tools, Codemod AI significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of autogenerated codemods.

This guide shows you how to build codemods using Codemod Studio. During this process you will learn different concepts such as:

- [Running codemods](#running-codemods)

## Navigating Codemod Studio

### Adding/Inspecting test cases

Test cases allow you to see how your codemod affects different code patterns. In Codemod Studio, you can:

- Add test cases
- Inspect a test case's abstract syntax tree (AST)
- Inspect the diff view of how your codemod affects the test case
- Inspect the matched code patterns

### Selecting language

Under the hood, Codemod Studio uses [ast-grep](https://ast-grep.github.io/), a fast and polyglot tool for code structural search, lint, rewriting at large scale. ast-grep allows Codemod Studio to support building and transforming codemods with many languages.

### Sharing codemods

After building a codemod, you can share and test your codemods with friends, team members, and the community.

### Managing sessions

Codemod Studio allows you to save and use multiple sessions. This helps making working on several codemods at once more manageable.

## Using Codemod AI

The AI assistant provides support and guidance throughout the codemod creation process. It leverages AI to help you generate codemod scripts, troubleshoot issues, and refine your code transformations.

To use Codemod AI, you can:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open Codemod AI">
        Click `Ask Codemod AI` to open the AI helper pane.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Prompt required changes">
        Prompt the change(s) you want to build a codemod for. Try to focus on building codemods for few granular changes at a time. Packing too many changes into one codemod significantly increases the chance of broken outputs.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Inspect test cases">
        Codemod AI will understand your prompt and recommend extra test cases that may improve coverage. You can inspect the generated test cases and make sure that the codemod you built transforms these test cases correctly.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Iterate and improve">
        If the codemod is not perfect on the first try, you can iterate and improve the codemod with the help of Codemod AI until you reach a satisfactory result.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Running codemods

Codemod Studio allows you to run codemods over your codebases without having to leave your web environment.

  src="/images/codemod-studio/running-codemod.mp4"
></video>

To run codemods, you can:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Choose target repository">
        Make sure you are logged into Codemod using your GitHub account and pick a target repository.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run codemod">
        Click `Run` to start running your codemod. Note that this will only dry-run the codemod and will not directly affect your codebase.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Inspect changes">
        You can click on each affected file and inspect the diff view of the changes made. If you catch any false positives or false negatives, you can go back to Codemod AI and iteratively improve your codemod.
    </Step>
</Steps>
