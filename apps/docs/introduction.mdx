## Why modernize with Codemod?

Codemod Platform keeps your code modern—continuously. It helps teams:

* **Spot modernization opportunities** in aging codebases.
* **Apply migrations** for frameworks, APIs, and dependencies.
* **Orchestrate and track** those changes across every repo and service.

By closing the loop from discovery to rollout, teams win back thousands of engineering hours and stop tech debt before it stacks up—regaining the speed and reliability that drive competitive edge.

The platform stands on two complementary foundations:

* **Open-source toolkit** – a free CLI and public registry maintained by the community, ensuring migrations stay current and battle-tested.
* **Enterprise capabilities** – Studio, Campaigns, Insights, and private registries that add creation, orchestration, and governance for larger engineering orgs.

Community-powered migrations, paired with enterprise-grade automation, make Codemod the gold standard for keeping codebases up to date.

## Problems it solves

* Continuous code modernization & framework upgrades (React 19, Nuxt 3 → 4, etc.)
* Large-scale API refactors & deprecations
* Security / compliance patches across fleets of services
* Dependency consistency, lint-fixes, and other “sweeping” chores
