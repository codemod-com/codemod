Codemod platform allows you to build a wide variety of codemods and easily distribute them to different parts of the platform, such as the [Codemod Registry](/codemod-registry) and [CLI](/deploying-codemods/cli). This allows them to be discovered, shared, and used by the community.

You can build codemods using three different ways:

- [Build with Codemod Studio](/codemod-studio#building-codemods-with-codemod-studio)
- [Build with codemod learn](/building-codemods/build-package#building-with-codemod-learn)
- [Scaffold a new codemod package](/building-codemods/build-package#scaffolding-a-codemod-package)
