Codemods have superpowers, but building them isn't easy. [Codemod Studio](/building-codemods/codemod-studio) lets you “instantly” create code transformation bots with AI, specialized helpers & debuggers, and a vibrant “codemod champion” community.

Alternatively, you can use [Codemod CLI](/deploying-codemods/cli) to initialize and build codemods locally.
