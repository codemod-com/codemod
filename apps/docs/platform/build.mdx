Codemod platform allows you to build a wide variety of codemods and easily distribute them to different parts of the platform, such as the [Codemod Registry](/codemod-registry), [CLI](/deploying-codemods/cli), and [VS Code extension](/deploying-codemods/vsce). This allows them to be discovered, shared, and used by the community.

There are two ways of scaffolding a new codemod package that follow the required package structure:
