## Benefits and features

Codemod platform allows you to connect your GitHub repos and run codemods right from your browser. This allows you to easily see how your codemods affect your codebase.

If you would like to run codemods locally instead, you can [run codemods with Codemod CLI](/deploying-codemods/cli#run).
