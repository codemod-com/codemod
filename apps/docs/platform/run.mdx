## Benefits and features

Running codemods with Codemod platform brings many benefits such as:
- advanced codemod [configuration](/codemod-registry/introduction#required-codemod-package-structure:codemodrc-json-reference) (pre/post-run commands, arguments, formatting, daisy-chaining, multi-threading, dry-running, and more)
- easily running codemods from different entry points, such as [CLI](/deploying-codemods/cli) and [IDE extension](/deploying-codemods/vsce), based on user preference.

## Getting started

Codemod platform allows you to run codemods using different ways:

### Option 1: Running via codemod's source
1. with [Codemod's opinionated scaffolding](/deploying-codemods/cli#codemod-init)
2. via [raw transform file](/deploying-codemods/cli#run) 

### Option 2: Running via codemods in Codemod Registry
1. via [CLI](/deploying-codemods/cli#run)
2. via [IDE extension](/deploying-codemods/vsce)
3. via web app ([Codemod Studio](/codemod-studio) or [Codemod registry](/codemod-registry))
