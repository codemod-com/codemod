Codemod platform allows you to easily share codemods with friends, team members, the open-source community.

By publishing your codemods to [Codemod Registry](/codemod-registry/introduction), you can easily share your codemods with thousands of people around the world.

Once added, they will automatically integrate with Codemod platform. This simplifies codemod discovery and distribution, and offers a better running codemods experience.
