Codemod platform allows you to easily share codemods with friends, team members, the open-source community by [publishing](/guides/sharing/publishing-codemods) them to [Codemod Registry](/codemod-registry/introduction).

Once published, they will automatically integrate with Codemod platform. This simplifies codemod discovery and distribution, and offers a better running codemods experience.
