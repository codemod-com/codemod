Codemod platform allows you to easily share codemods with friends, team members, the open-source community by publishing them to [Codemod Registry](/codemod-registry).

Once published, they will automatically integrate with Codemod platform. This simplifies codemod discovery and distribution, and offers a better running codemods experience.

There are three ways to publish codemods to Codemod Registry:
- [publishing a codemod package](/sharing/publishing-codemods#option-1-publishing-a-codemod-compatible-package-recommended)
- [publishing from source file](/sharing/publishing-codemods#option-2-publishing-a-codemod-from-source-file)
- [publishing with Codemod Studio](/sharing/publishing-codemods#option-3-publishing-with-codemod-studio)
