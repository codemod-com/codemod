Codemod allows you to confidently plan and execute large-scale code migrations by providing essential tooling to:
    1.    **Spot modernization opportunities** with [Insights](/insights) dashboards and upcoming *Opportunity Finder* scans.
    2.    **Evaluate impact & effort**: metric-driven views help engineers and tech-leaders prioritise migrations.
