    In large codebases, tracking migrations, legacy and current APIs, security anti-patterns, and trends can be incredibly useful. 

    With Codemod Insights, you can generate customized dashboards that provide valuable insights into your code’s posture as your codebases scale over time. This way, you can stay on top of your codebase’s evolution and make better-informed decisions.

    **Getting started:**

	1. **Create a New Dashboard**: Dashboards allow you to organize a set of related widgets together.
	2. **Add and Customize Widgets**: Create new widgets using ast-grep YAML rules, and Codemod will automatically scan your codebase and track how various code patterns change over time.
	3. **Track Code Changes**: With your dashboard(s) configured, you'll have a comprehensive overview of your codebase's posture, enabling you to make more informed decisions.
