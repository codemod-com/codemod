    In large codebases, tracking migrations, legacy and current APIs, security anti-patterns, and trends can be incredibly useful. 

    With Codemod Insights, you can generate customized dashboards that provide valuable insights into your codeâ€™s posture as your codebases scale over time. This way, you can stay on top of your codebaseâ€™s evolution and make better-informed decisions.

    **Getting started:**

	1. **Create a New Dashboard**: Dashboards allow you to organize a set of related widgets together.
	2. **Add and Customize Widgets**: Create new widgets using ast-grep YAML rules, and Codemod will automatically scan your codebase and track how various code patterns change over time.
	3. **Track Code Changes**: With your dashboard(s) configured, you'll have a comprehensive overview of your codebase's posture, enabling you to make more informed decisions.
