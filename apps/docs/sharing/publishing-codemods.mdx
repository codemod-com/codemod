This guide will walk you through the steps needed to publish codemods to [Codemod Registry](/codemod-registry). 

There are three ways to publish codemods to Codemod Registry:
1. [publishing a codemod package](#option-1-publishing-a-codemod-compatible-package-recommended)
2. [publishing from source file](#option-2-publishing-a-codemod-from-source-file)
3. publishing with Codemod Studio (Coming soon)

<Tip>
Publishing codemods to the registry is especially useful for framework/library builders. With features like shareable codemod deep links and Codemod CLI & IDE extenion, your users can adopt your latest releases with one click, straight from your migration doc. <Tooltip tip="MSW V2 migration">[See example ->](https://mswjs.io/docs/migrations/1.x-to-2.x/#codemods)</Tooltip>

## Publishing codemods

### Option 1: Publishing a Codemod-compatible package (recommended)

Creating and publishing a [Codemod-compatible package](/building-codemods/package-requirements) brings an enhanced codemod running experience.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Build a codemod package">
        To publish a codemod to Codemod Registry, the codemod package needs to be compatible with Codemod platform. To learn how to build Codemod-compatible codemods, please refer to the [building codemods guide](/building-codemods/build-package).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Login to Codemod platform">
        If you are not already logged in, login to Codemod platform using:
        ```bash
        codemod login
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Publish codemod">
        Move to your codemod package directory and run:
        ```bash
        codemod publish
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Option 2: Publishing a codemod from source file

<Steps>
    <Step title="Login to Codemod platform">
        If you are not already logged in, login to Codemod platform using:
        ```bash
        codemod login
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Publish codemod">
        Publish the codemod from source path:

        <Note>
        To generate a [Codemod-compatible package](/building-codemods/package-requirements), Codemod CLI will ask you a few questions about your codemod to generate the [`codemodrc.json` configuration file](/building-codemods/package-requirements#codemodrc-json-reference) automatically for you.
        </Note>

        <Tip>If you want to use ESM-specific features like top-level `await` or `import.meta`, you can rename it to use `.mjs` or `.mts` extension or specify `--esm` flag to treat the source file as ESM package explicitly.</Tip>

        ```bash
        codemod publish [path] --source
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Unpublishing codemods

To unpublish a codemod from Codemod Registry, you can use the [`codemod unpublish` command](/deploying-codemods/cli#codemod-unpublish).
