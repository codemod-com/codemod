# A better way to build, discover, & run codemods

![Discover Codemods](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codemod-com/codemod/main/apps/vsce/img/vsce-quick-look.gif)

## 1. Build

- Leverage the **1-click integration with Codemod Studio** and the feedback loop with the **community of Codemod Champions** to continuously improve Codemods and customize them to your needs.

## 2. Discover

- Codemod is **a one-stop shop for discovering & sharing quality-governed codemods.** You don't need to install and run many codemod engines for each dependency. Simply search for your framework codemods and click run. With codemod deep links, you can reach & run your target codemod with just one click.

## 3. Run

- **Safely dry-run the codemods**, preview the changes with a user-friendly experience, adjust the changes as necessary, and apply them to your code only when you feel confident.

## Other Features

- **Out-of-the-box Prettier Integration -** Your favorite code transformation engines such as Metaâ€™s JSCodeshift or TS-morph will mess up the formatting. Codemod will automatically prettify the changes according to your settings, saving you much time and energy for more exciting features.
- **Multi-threading -** Execute codemods faster than you would with vanilla jscodeshift or ts-morph. Codemod's engine uses multi-threading, which is customizable via extension settings, to take full advantage of your machine's computing power and expedite large-scale changes.
