### Generate codemod from file diff

The `learn` command can be used to send the diff of the latest edited file to the Codemod Studio and have it automatically build an explainable and debuggable codemod.

After running this command, if any git diff exists, `codemod` will use the diff as before/after snippets in the [Codemod Studio](https://codemod.studio).
